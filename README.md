# ClassSchedulePlanning
This is an Android app designed for use by students to determine if the distance between their classes is walkable, although it can be utilized by any user who wants to judge if the walk between two events is feasible. Since the app is primarily designed for UIUC students, it uses a default benchmark of 10 minutes between classes and based on this, analyzes a student's schedule to calculate the walking distances between each of his/her consecutive classes and classifies them based on how long the walk is predicted to be.
